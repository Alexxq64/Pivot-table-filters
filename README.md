### Optimization Techniques for Setting the `Visible` Property in Pivot Table Filters  

The provided filtering functions implement optimizations to avoid situations where no `PivotItem` is visible, which could result in an error or incorrect pivot table behavior. These optimizations are implemented through two main methods: **shifting the filtering start point** in the month filtering function and **using two passes** in the manufacturer filtering function.  

### Why Modify `Visible` Only When Necessary?  
1. **Recalculation Overhead**:  
   Any change to the `Visible` property of a `PivotItem` in a pivot table triggers a recalculation of the entire table. This recalculation happens regardless of whether the visibility of that `PivotItem` actually changed.  

2. **Performance Impact**:  
   - **Without optimization**: Processing all elements (even those already correctly visible or hidden) leads to unnecessary recalculations, which can significantly increase execution time.  
   - **With optimization**: By modifying the `Visible` property only for items requiring a change, recalculations are minimized, resulting in faster execution.  

For large tables with many `PivotItem` elements, this optimization can reduce execution time by up to **20 times**, as seen in the examples for filtering months and manufacturers.

### Two Methods for Optimizing `Visible` Property Modifications  

#### **1. Shift in the Month Filtering Function (`FilterByMonths`)**  

##### Purpose of the Shift  
The shift ensures that at least one `PivotItem` (month) remains visible during filtering, avoiding a situation where all items are hidden.  

##### Why Is the Shift Necessary?  
- **Avoiding an Empty Pivot Table**: If no items are visible, the pivot table becomes invalid, causing errors. The shift adjusts the filtering process so that the first item in the passed array of months is prioritized and remains visible.  
- **Guaranteeing Visibility**: The shift realigns the indices of the months, ensuring that the first visible month corresponds to the starting point of the filtering process.  

##### How the Shift Works  
- The filtering loop begins with the first month from the array (`monthNumbers`) and calculates indices relative to this starting point.  
- This guarantees that the first month in the array is visible, while other months are processed relative to this shifted start.

#### **2. Two Passes in the Manufacturer Filtering Function (`FilterByManufacturers`)**  

##### Purpose of Two Passes  
The two-pass approach ensures that only the desired manufacturers are visible, while all others are hidden. This method guarantees that no visible items are accidentally left out, preventing errors in the pivot table.  

##### Why Are Two Passes Necessary?  
- **First Pass**: Ensures that the required manufacturers (from the passed array `manufacturerNames`) are visible. The function loops through all `PivotItem` elements, matching their names to the provided list and marking them as visible.  
- **Second Pass**: Hides any remaining manufacturers that were not included in the list. This ensures that only the desired items are visible while all others are correctly hidden.  

##### Avoiding Performance Bottlenecks  
Using two passes separates the logic of making required items visible and hiding unnecessary items. This avoids redundant recalculations during the visibility changes, maintaining performance while ensuring accurate filtering.

### Conclusion  

1. **Shift in Month Filtering**:  
   The shift guarantees that at least one month remains visible, preventing an empty pivot table and ensuring a robust filtering process.  

2. **Two Passes in Manufacturer Filtering**:  
   The two-pass method ensures all required manufacturers are visible and all others are hidden. This avoids inconsistencies while optimizing performance by minimizing unnecessary recalculations.  

Both techniques ensure efficient and error-free pivot table filtering, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex pivot table structures.
