### 1. **Shift in the Month Filtering Function (`FilterByMonths`)**
#### Why is the shift used?
The shift in the month filtering function (`FilterByMonths`) is necessary for the proper functioning of month filtering to avoid a situation where all items in the pivot table become invisible.

#### Why shift?

Without the shift, the pivot table might end up with no visible items. The shift guarantees that at least one item will remain visible.
The first month in the array of months passed will be the first in the loop, and it will be visible. That means at least one month (the first from the array) will be visible.

If the shift is not used, the entire pivot table might be left without any visible items. The shift helps to adjust the indices of the months, ensuring that at least one month is visible, as the shift moves the filtering start to a different month.

### 2. **Two Passes in the Manufacturer Filtering Function (`FilterByManufacturers`)**
#### Why are two passes used?
Two passes are necessary in the manufacturer filtering function (`FilterByManufacturers`) to ensure correct display and hiding of items in the pivot table. This mechanism helps avoid a situation where no visible items remain in the pivot table (for example, if all manufacturers are hidden).

#### Filtering Process:

- **First pass**: The function checks all items in the pivot table and for each manufacturer, it checks whether they are in the list of passed manufacturers (`manufacturerNames`). If the item is present, its visibility is set to `True`.
- **Second pass**: After the first pass, the function checks all items that were not set as visible and sets their visibility to `False` (i.e., hides them if they are not in the list of selected manufacturers).

In the first pass, we set the visibility for only those manufacturers present in the passed list. However, this does not guarantee that the remaining items in the pivot table will be hidden.
In the second pass, we handle all the remaining items and ensure that only the required items (manufacturers) are visible, while the rest are hidden.

### Conclusion

- The shift in the month filtering function is necessary to prevent a situation where there will be no visible items in the pivot table. It ensures that at least one month will be displayed, despite any changes in the month indices.

- The two passes in the manufacturer filtering function are necessary to correctly set the visibility of all items, preventing a situation where all items are hidden. In the first pass, we make only the required manufacturers visible, and in the second, we hide all others, ensuring only the relevant data is displayed.

Thus, both techniques (the shift and the two passes) serve to prevent an empty pivot table, which is crucial for proper filtering functionality in Excel.
